# based on trac_urls written by wombie
# Needs to go in the plugins dir for rbot

Requires the following gems:

* mechanize (1.x +)
* nokogiri

Configuration options (to be placed in conf.yaml)

redmine_urls.channelmap - A map of channels to the base Redmine URL that should be used in that channel.  Format for each entry in the list #channel:http://redmine.site/to/use.  Don't put a trailing slash on the base URL, please.

redmine_urls.projectmap - A map of channels to Redmine projects to be queried in that channel.  
Format for each entry in the list is #channel:project.  This setting is needed for wiki and changeset queries where the project name is embedded in the query.  Currently only one project can be monitored per channel.

redmine_urls.auth_pass - Password for basic http authentification to the Redmine site
